# aws-r-quick-fetch-code
This is a simple mechanism to quickly fetch most popular data formats in R using the cloudyR aws.s3 library.

Currently, there are functions for csv, JSON, zip files (with reading both JSON and csv inside them)

I'll try to add more functions such as that of xml

This is meant to serve as a quick-refresher or go-to to fetch data and process it as dataframe quickly in R Studio and R Studio Server.
